            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Since these films are so recent and data compilation had not been created either for the films nor any data concerning the Manson family themselves, I had to rent each film and watch while taking notes. After an early obsession with the Tate-LaBianca case in 2015, I had re-read most of Vincent Bugliosi's <em>Helter Skelter</em> to refresh the details and dates of the events. <em>Helter Skelter</em> is frequently indentified as the leading work on the Manson timeline, while also being criticized for Bugliosi's personal bias as the case prosecutor. Hard data was hard to come by, most of the research besides that of historical accuracy and audience reception is that of affect from my own analysis and connection to the pieces of media toward their original source.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the work went into who occurred frequently in the films and who were the most important within these chosen. While in two of the films the Manson family in almost their entirety appear, there are few characters who are called by name, have lines, or are integral to development or plot. I knew already who were the main players in the crimes committed as far as victims and perpetrators so I needed to identify if they appeared in each film and what name they were credited under (the Manson family used a variety of nicknames and "new" names, each film credits member's names differently, either by legal name or famous nickname i.e. Sadie for Susan Atkins).&nbsp;</p><p>Representation became an important part as well, as culturally the family - especially being convicted criminals - are looked at as being cultish, bloodthirsty beings. A research question came into mind after the intial theatrical release of Once Upon a Time and the cultural criticsm thinkpieces surrounding if Atkins and Krenwinkel should have been brutalized the way that they were at the end of the film. Many came to the agreement that this was fine, others saw it as misogyny against teenage girls. I wanted to know what the film texts were actually conveying to the audience in regards to this, as well as Sharon Tate and the person she was or could be.&nbsp;</p></div>

Originally I was interested in making a small video project but discarded the idea out of effort in time as well as feeling this did not prove any point. A map would be integral for a visual representation to see where the events occurred and how far especially the Manson family traveled for their own gain. The audience reception data came directly from Internet Movie Database (as mentioned in the bibliography). Using IMDb does run the risk of users rating a film highly or poorly out of any sort of bias for the film, filmmaker or otherwise even without watching the film. The breakdown of the data is evident on the "Timeline and Reception" page, in which the results did not suprise me partly from being a Twitter user reading responses especially to the Tarantino film but seeing critical write-up of<em> Charlie Says</em> or <em>The Haunting of Sharon Tate</em> - the latter film being lambasted.&nbsp;</p><p>An infographic comparing each film seemed integral to fully understanding the similarities and differences with each film as well. Again, most hard data would come from IMDb since the rest of the project would be heavily qualitative. The timeline was also a non-negotiable in understanding historical context and where the films each sit.&nbsp;</p></div>
