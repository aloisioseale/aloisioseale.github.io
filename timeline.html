                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Response to this film out of all three films was generally poor, as seen by the 2.9 average out of a score of ten out of nearly 2,400 ratings. From the 124 user reviews, most users find the film "exploitative" in regards to seeing Sharon Tate and her friends die brutally not once, but twice on screen as well as adding the element of seeing into the future for Tate's characterization. Users are generally kind to Hilary Duff as an actress and some even praise her performance, but most question her as to why she would take on the project. Most of the arguments from higher raters talk about the film not "being a documentary" and seem to misinterpret the ending, that in which Tate attacks the family and seems to get away, but the reality is pulled back and it is revealed that Tate and her friends are ghosts at the scene of the crime. Potentially even worse, as some one-star reviews see, is that the ghost of Sharon Tate holds her unborn child in the last shot. Most reviewers rag on the effects as well as the acting. No reviewers bring up the acting or presentation of any other character besides Tate. Most comment on how Duff pulls off looking like Tate - most reviews are not fans - and one reviewer comments on the "whininess" of her character, causing them to not want to watch the film anymore. One interesting review refers to director Daniel Farrand's intentions, making the setting of the story metaphysical and spiritual. While information on that is unclear, the setting of the film being on a different earthly plane was not evident. The film did not have a theatrical release, but was at small genre film festivals and made its VOD debut in May 2019 with availability on Amazon Prime recently, allowing more viewers.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This out of the other two films recieves the most varied and at times nuanced user reviews and such is evident in the data above, though the most common score being a 5.7. This film being more of a historical drama rather than psychological horror like the last film garners more younger viewers in the 18-29 age range. "Feminist" seems to be a common word in reviews, as well as pointing to historical accuracy. A few reviews do say that the film is historically inaccurate, without pointing to specifics, especially in regards to the representations of the Manson girls. Lots of user reviews wrestle with their personal views of the Manson family from before seeing the film and either buy into the portrayals or continue to question the sincerity of the real life women. Response to the performances, specifically by Hannah Murray and Matt Smith, are generally positive. A few reviews praise the film's focus on Van Houten and the other girls rather than overarching on Manson himself, but will still praise Smith's performance as him. Self-proclaimed "history buffs" are happy with the historical accuracy, but bring up minimal changes. There is no mention of other characters besides the family and the focus is mostly on Van Houten and Manson as central characters. The film started on the film festival circuit and then as a limited release in independent and art theaters. The film was also released on VOD in May, but is not currently on any AVOD or SVOD platforms.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This film more than the other two films has more and higher ratings with the average score being a 7.8 and a high range of viewership across gender and age. Most users rate the film positively, though one might believe there are elements of recency bias as well as bigger talk for the film in certain circles such as media internet spaces. The user reviews talk heavily about Tarantino's intentions, some being more fans of his or not, some critical of his track record of wanting to showcase his knowledge of especially film history on screen. Responses to Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate are overwhelmingly positive. Many users are telling others that if one is not familiar with the Manson family that it is imperative to know about them before watching the film. A few users bring up their comprehensive knowledge about Manson and how little he as a person shows up and their suprise with the revisionist ending. A few users were confused by the inclusion of Tate due to the central part of the film being on Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Many like the scene at Spahn Ranch when Brad Pitt meets the family and the intensity and performances of the scene. Generally, however, the users who do manage to write reviews are one or two-star reviewers and call the film "boring", a "waste of time", "pretentious" and do not like feeling left in the dark in regards to not knowing about Los Angeles in 1968-1969. The film opened at Cannes Film Festival and then in nationwide theaters in July with a November VOD release. The higher numbers for this film as opposed to the other two films can be fully attributed to wider release and heavy marketing, especially in Los Angeles-New York markets.&nbsp;</p>
